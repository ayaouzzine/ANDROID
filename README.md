# ANDROID
M4.6.2 Project
This is the merge of the two first parts (registration, validation, login, redirection to client/admin homepage + displaying auctions from database with initial price, highest price, description, category and related information).
To run this project, place first the folder 'android' in your xampp/htdocs folder then change the URL_REGISTER to your own one (just change the IP adress : you can type in your cmd.exe the following command >ipconfig /all then you will find the IPV4 value under the section 'Carte r√©seau sans fil Wi-Fi')
That's all! After this you will be able to run the E-AUCTION app. Enjoy!
