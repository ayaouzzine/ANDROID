# ANDROID
M4.6.2 Project : This is the final merge of the two first parts (registration, validation, login, redirection to client/admin homepage + displaying auctions from database with initial price, highest price, description, category and related information). 
To run this project, you don't have to place first the folder 'android' in your xampp/htdocs folder anymore because php files and the database are now hosted ! 
That's all! You are now able to run the E-AUCTION app. Enjoy
